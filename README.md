# Programming Basics: Logical Operators - True or False? 

- create a file called `solution.js` and add your work there

## 1. What type? 

- Answer the questions below with `console.log`; print out the number of the correct answer in the Terminal (oneby one

* Which of the following is used to compare the VALUE of two variables/values?

* Which of the following is used to compare the VALUE and TYPE of two variables/values?

## 2. Comparison

* Check whether `3` is equal to `"3"` using loose comparison. Print out the result.

* Then, check whether they are equal while using strict comparison. Print out the result.

## 3. Not

* Complete the following ternary code to print out 'good evening' using 'myVar':
```javascript
let myVar = true;

console.log( .............. ? 'good morning' : 'good evening' );
```

## 4. Short Circuit

* Complete the following code by filling the spaces with '&&' or '||' to get the value that fits the variable's name:
(PS: these values will always return false: `false` , `0`, `''`)

```javascript

let zero  = '' .... false .... 0
let seven = 75 .... 'nine' .... 7
let firstName = '' .... 'John' .... 0
let emptyStr  = '' .... false .... 'Hello World'

console.log(zero, seven, firstName, emptyStr);
```
